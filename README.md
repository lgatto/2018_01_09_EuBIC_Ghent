## Open source and open development proteomics software 

### Abstract

Developing good scientific is difficult in many ways, considering that
it often relies on diverse skills (such as programming and scientific)
and needs to appeal to a broad audience (users and developers,
computational and experimentalists), features that are often difficult
to combine. In my talk, I would like to present a set of Bioconductor
software for mass spectrometry and proteomics I directly develop or
contribute to. I will briefly describe the software and some
interesting technical characteristics, and mention features that I
believe are important for good scientific software. I will also show
how some of these software packages evolved over time, greatly
benefited from external contributions, and how they fit into a broader
software ecosystem.
