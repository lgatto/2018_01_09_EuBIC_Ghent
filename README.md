# Open source and open development proteomics software 

Developing good scientific is difficult in many ways, considering that
it often relies on diverse skills (such as programming and scientific)
and needs to appeal to a broad audience (users and developers,
computational and experimentalists), features that are often difficult
to combine. In my talk, I would like to present a set of Bioconductor
software for mass spectrometry and proteomics I directly develop or
contribute to. I will briefly describe the software and some
interesting technical characteristics, and mention features that I
believe are important for good scientific software. I will also show
how some of these software packages evolved over time, greatly
benefited from external contributions, and how they fit into a broader
software ecosystem.
